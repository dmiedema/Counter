        <h3>It seems that apps with waiting lists are all the rage lately.</h3>

<p>Well now, you can have an app that <strong>only</strong> counts down. <em>Why?</em> is probably a very valid question.</p>

<p>My answer is, it's not about <strong>what</strong> the app does but how fuckin good the hype is for the app.</p>

<p>This app? Pure. Hype.</p>

<p>You can't beat an app that only counts down to 0 in regards to hype.</p>

<p>So hype it up!</p>
