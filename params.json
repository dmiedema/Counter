{"name":"Counter","tagline":"It's all about the hype","body":"### It seems that apps with waiting lists are all the rage lately.\r\n\r\nWell now, you can have an app that **only** counts down. *Why?* is probably a very valid question.\r\n\r\nMy answer is, it's not about **what** the app does but how fuckin good the hype is for the app.\r\n\r\nThis app? Pure. Hype.\r\n\r\nYou can't beat an app that only counts down to 0 in regards to hype.\r\n\r\nSo hype it up!\r\n\r\n###Support\r\nJust shoot me an email, daniel@danielmiedema.com\r\n\r\n###LICENSE\r\n\r\nRNBlurModalView is license under the MIT li\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Daniel Miedema\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, \r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE \r\nDISCLAIMED.
